   <h3>Bismarck</h3> <br>
<p>From the mist a shape, a ship is taking form
    And the silence of the sea is about to drift into a storm
    Sign of power, show of force
    Raise the anchor battleship plotting its course
    
    Pride of a nation a beast made of steel
    Bismarck in motion king of the ocean
    
    He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
    To lead the warmachine
    To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
    The terror of the seas
    The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine
    
    Two thousand men, and fifty thousand tonnes of steel
    Set the course for the Atlantic with the allies on their heel
    Firepower, firefight
    Battlestations, keep the targets steady in sight
    
    Into formation, the hunt has begun
    Death and damnation, the fleet is coming
    
    He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
    To lead the warmachine
    To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
    The terror of the seas
    The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine
    
    At the bottom of the ocean the depths of the abyss
    They are bound by iron and blood
    The flagship of the navy the terror of the seas
    His guns have gone silent at last
    
    Pride of a nation a beast made of steel
    Bismarck in motion king of the ocean
    
    He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
    To lead the warmachine
    To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
    The terror of the seas
    The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine
    
    To lead the warmachine
    Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
    
    The terror of the seas
    Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine
    
    To lead the warmachine
    Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
    
    The terror of the seas
    Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine
